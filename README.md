# Style_Transfer
This is a small and interesting project. I want to transfer my head portrait to an funny style.  

In this project,  Iâ€™ll recreate a style transfer method that is outlined in the paper, Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks, by Gatys in PyTorch. 


Some contents and structure in this notebook are referenced from Udacity deep learning class.
